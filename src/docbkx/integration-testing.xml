    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>The execution of integration tests is handled by the 
      <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-failsafe-plugin/">Maven Failsafe Plugin</ulink>
      in contradiction to the 
      <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-surefire-plugin/">Maven Surefire Plugin</ulink>
      for the unit tests.
      
      By assuming that you are already familiar with Maven and it's 
      <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html">directory layout</ulink>
      you know where to put unit tests but unfortunately there does not exist a 
      definition or a convention like this for integration tests. There are some suggestions circulating
      around like <literal>src/it/java</literal>, but these are only rumors.
   </para>    

   <para>
      In this guide we suggest to put them into the same directory structure
      like the unit tests which means in other words <literal>src/test/java</literal> and
      make them distinguishable by the
      <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-failsafe-plugin/integration-test-mojo.html#includes">naming conventions</ulink>
      but in future Maven releases this might be changed.
