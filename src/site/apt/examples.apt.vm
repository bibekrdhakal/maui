Examples

  This guide describes many aspects of Maven by using examples, cause it would
  be too boring to printout all examples in full detail which would veil 
  the details of he Maven configuration and how to do things with Maven which 
  is the real intention of this guide. So all Maven examples are only excerpts
  of the full fledged examples which can be downloaded via the following links:

  * {{{./maui-${project.version}-src.tar.gz}Examples as tar.gz archive}}

  * {{{./maui-${project.version}-src.tar.bz2}Examples as tar.bz2 archive}}

  * {{{./maui-${project.version}-src.zip}Examples as zip archive}}
