  Container Integration Test Example

Integration Test Example Container

  This example will describe how to do integration-testing with
  a web application which will be deployed to a servlet container
  like {{{http://tomcat.apache.org}Tomcat}}.

  In this example we use the {{{http://cargo.codehaus.org/Home}CARGO Plugin}}
  to do the integration test of a web application. By the help of Cargo it's
  simply possible to do the startup of a container, deploy the web application
  (war) start the container and run the integration tests and finally stop the
  container.

  {{{http://cargo.codehaus.org/Home#Home-ContainerSupport}Cargo supports a large number of containers}}
  which can be used either via the {{{http://cargo.codehaus.org/Javadocs}Java API}}
  or in our case via the {{{http://cargo.codehaus.org/Maven2+plugin}Maven 2/3 Plugin}}.

  This is of course not the only possibility to start a container,
  but in my opinion the simplest one but in spite of that very effective.

  In this example we have the following structure of the different modules which
  are more or less typical for a Maven project which contains a WAR part. This
  is also true if you have EAR part.

  This first example does not contain any real integration test it will show
  only the structure of how an integration test looks like in relationship
  with a WAR package.

  Now let us focus on the <<<mod-it>>> module which contains the configuration for
  the <<<cargo-maven2-plugin>>> which is responsible to start, deploy and stop the
  container.


  One of the most important things is that your <<<mod-it>>> module contains a dependency
  to your war project which looks like this in the <<<pom.xml>>> file.
  
%{include|source=it-example-container/mod-it/pom.xml|snippet=#war-dependency}
  
  Furthermore we take a look onto the configuration for the cargo-maven2-plugin which
  contains first the kind of container we would like to run which is defined by the
  <<<containerId>>> and the <<<zipUrlInstaller>>> area which defines where to
  get the container from. In this example the container (Tomcat) will be downloaded
  automatically from the given download area (url) downloaded into the given
  folder <<<downloadDir>>> and extracted into the given folder <<<extractDir>>>.
  Here we use the default which is defined by the <<<cargo-maven2-plugin>>>.

  This approach has the advantage that you don't need to have an installed
  Tomcat somewhere. This build will work on every platform. The only limitation
  is that the download via the given url needs internet access.

  The other important thing is under which port the given instance of Tomcat
  will run which is defined by the <<<cargo.servlet.port>>>. This might be changed
  later using an environment variable to be able to control it from outside.
  This can be usefull if you are running on an continous integration solution
  like Jenkins etc.

~~
~~ We have to update the example with the new version of cargo, cause the parameter downloadDir and extractDir have
~~ changed.

%{include|source=it-example-container/mod-it/pom.xml|snippet=#cargo-plugin}

  The next part is to start the container and deploy the war file into the container
  which can be achieved by using the following execution block. The <<<pingURL>>>
  is needed to see if your application startup is finished or not. The
  <<<pingTimeout>>> defines how long this will be tried in the worst case. The
  value is given in ms. The context is usually the name of the war file, but 
  this is not very convenient so you can change this by using the <<<context>>> 
  property to control this.
  Further details can be found in the documentation of the cargo-maven2-plugin.

%{include|source=it-example-container/mod-it/pom.xml|snippet=#cargo-plugin-start-execution}

  And last but not least the final part stopping the container is simply
  configured by the following execution block.

%{include|source=it-example-container/mod-it/pom.xml|snippet=#cargo-plugin-stop-execution}
